# SystemThemeSwitcher

A modified version of [maddie480's AutoThemeSwitcher plugin](https://github.com/maddie480/Vencord-AutoThemeSwitcher) for [Vencord, a Discord client mod](https://vencord.dev) that automatically switches between custom light and dark themes based on your system appearance settings rather than time of day.

## Installing The Plugin

Please refer to [the Vencord docs](https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/) for instructions on installing and updating userplugins.

## Theme Configurations

The dropdown allows you to pick the base "Light" and "Dark" themes, and all of the Nitro themes. **Using Nitro themes requires Nitro, or activating the FakeNitro plugin.**

Additionally, you can specify CSS theme URLs. If you fill those fields, this will **replace** your "Online Themes" settings when the theme is toggled. The choice of Light or Dark theme will still have an effect.
